# Disease-Prediction-System

## Machine Learning Directory
Contains .ipynb files ( Machine Learning Models ) and Datasets.
You can view each disease's .ipynb file and dataset in their folder.

## Backend Directory
Contains .pkl files generated by Machine Learning models.
And contains a Python file to use that .pkl file by making an API.

### To run the Backend
Delete the ml folder ( it is there only for ref purposes for someone who wants it. )

Go to the Backend directory in your terminal and run the snippets mentioned below, in order to create a new env directory and run the backend.

python -m venv YOU_NEW_DIRECTORY_NAME

.\YOU_NEW_DIRECTORY_NAME\Scripts\activate

pip install uvicorn gunicorn fastapi pydantic scikit-learn pandas
 
uvicorn mlapi:app --reload


## Frontend Directory
For frontend integration with ML, I used React JS

### To run Frontend

Go to Frontend dir in your terminal and run,

npm install

NPM RUN DEV
